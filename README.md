# HerokuBans
## Repository for tracking which packages are banned on Heroku

### What ?
This repository is made for knowing if a package is banned or not
### How ?
Each branch deploys a very simple app (in one file or two) and the specified package. Then, I'm charged to deploy them and track if it's effectively banned or not
### Why ?
Because Heroku bans a lot of things nowadays  
And also because you may need to know if *this* package is banned before including it in your app...

## Tracking :

| Package name | Banned ? | Alternatives | Branch link to report |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
